    Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
    practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
    Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.

          Learn HTML
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
          HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the
          standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML describes
          the structure of a website semantically along with cues for
          presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming
          language.

          What is CSS?
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
          describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
          (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
          how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
          on other media.

          Basics of JavaScript
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
          JavaScript is a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted
          programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript
          language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the
          three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production.

          Working with Web Forms
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
          Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user
          and a web site or application. Forms allow users to enter data,
          which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage
          (see Sending form data later in the module), or used on the
          client-side to immediately update the interface in some way.

          Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at
          responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS-

          buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

          Using React and other JavaScript frameworks and libraries

          JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web
          development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for
          building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern
          companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so
          many front-end development jobs now require framework experience

          Accessibility Guide
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
          Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as
          many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being
          about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites
          accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile
          devices, or those with slow network connections.

          Using Version Control
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
          Version control is important for all code, files, and assets that
          multiple team members will collaborate on. Using version control
          software helps you keep track of changes — and keep every team
          member working off the latest version.
