              Android app development is the process by which new applications
              are created for the Android devices operating system. Applications
              are usually developed in <strong>Java</strong> and/or
              <strong>Kotlin</strong> programming language using the Android app
              software development kit (SDK), but other development environments
              are also available. Google announced in 2019 to make Kotlin the
              preferred way of developing android applications.

            Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose
            programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to
            interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard
            library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows
            its syntax to be more concise.

            software helps you keep track of changes — and keep every team
            member working off the latest version.

            Notifications are messages that are shown to the user outside of
            your app's UI. A typical notification consists of a title, a
            description, and an icon. A notification can also have clickable
            actions, a quick reply, extendable content, and images.

            Adding Animation to Application

          <p class="description">
            Animation is a powerful tool for helping users understand a
            potentially complex and confusing screenful of information. When a
            single item is updated, animating that change can help the user
            understand what happened. When many items change, animations can
            help transition the user from one UI to the next, so that they
            understand the context and implications of the changes.

            Building apps with Google Maps allows you to add features to your
            app such as satellite imagery, robust UI controls for maps, location
            tracking, and location markers. You can add value to the standard
            Google Maps by showing information from your own data set, such as
            the locations of well-known fishing or climbing areas.

            Testing and Dependency Injection
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            When you implemented the first feature of your first app, you likely
            ran the code to verify that it worked as expected. You performed a
            test, albeit a manual test. As you continued to add and update
            features, you probably also continued to run your code and verify it
            works.<br />
            Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement
            IoC(Inversion of Control). It allows the creation of dependent
            objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class
            through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding
            of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.

            Creating a Login for your Application

          <p class="description">
            By allowing users to log in and create an identity within your app,
            you can provide them with more ways to interact with the app. With
            personalized accounts, users can customize their in-app experience,
            engage with other users, and have their data persisted and
            transferred if they're using the app on another device
